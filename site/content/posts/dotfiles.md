## My Most Used terminal tools

> This post is really random

- *Text Editor*: [nvim](https://neovim.io/) as my primary config with [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
    - honorable mention to [zed](https://zed.dev/), which has been amazing
- *Shell*: [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) Z-Shell as my default shell with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- *WM*: [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) as my Window Manager
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) as my Terminal Multiplexer
