# Workflow

I've never had my self working on solely the terminal before. It would be only a few occasions when the GUI alternative was simply frustrating to use. I've since forced myself to try and venture more, and now I simply can't work without them. I have even lost count for the number of times i've used vim motions accidentally.

At first, yes these things were a bit intriguing, but once u leave the learning curve, everything just falls in place. You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/bwaklog)

## My Most Used terminal tools

- **Text Editor**: [nsim](https://neovim.io/) as my primary config with [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
    - honorable mention to [zed](https://zed.dev/), which has been amazing
- **Shell**: [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) Z-Shell as my default shell with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- **WM**: [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) as my Window Manager
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) as my Terminal Multiplexer
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and when thats buggy, [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)


```bash
‚ùØ history | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
```
```text
 821 git
 436 nvim
 406 cd
 361 go
 350 ls
 349 la
 271 ./ssg
 256 clear
 199 make
  81 tmux
```
(ps) I recently cleared my `zsh_history` and as you can see, i struggle with git a lot

## Extras

This is something i just pulled out of reddit recently and would love to share it. Thanks to [u/77ilham77](https://reddit.com/u/77ilham77), there is a way to move windows without the title bar and I absolutely love it. It's just a simple command and viola you are read. This allows you to hold down `<C-CMD>` and lets u move the window with your mouse.

```bash
defaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture -bool true 
```
