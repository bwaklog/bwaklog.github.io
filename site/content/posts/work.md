# Effort vs. Result

9th Mar 2024

Aditya Hegde

<br/>

Just a few thoughts off of my mind, my perspective on effort. It's something I'm a bit particular about. For me personally there is wall separating work achived from hard work and work done for the sake of it. A wall nothing no one can pass through unless you change your approach or perspective of a situation. I'm a person who is really particular about my job. I tend to put myself down, and set unrealistic expectations at times. Now people would say, i'm crazy for it. But weirdly, its that mindset for me that makes me want to do more.

<br/>

Every second part of your effort on something counts, it makes a difference. For me, the end result must showcase that effort. It won't matter that you have worked *x* hours, if your final result doesn't match the effort of these *x* hours, somwhere in the process you've missed out on something. Telling the world about the _effort_ can not be your justification for the outcome.
