# Heres an example code using `stdlib.h`

We will make use of `stdlib.h` header file for dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`

```C
int main() {
    int *p; // this is where we store the pointer ajshdakjsdhsakhdakjsd akjsdha fdskjfsdf kds
    int a = 10;
    p = &a; // we store mem addr of a in pointer p
    /* snip */
}
```
