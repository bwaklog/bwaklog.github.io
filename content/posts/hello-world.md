Hey there!  
Welcome to my mini blog! I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at PESU. I am a student based in Bengaluru, India. Currently suffering in my [_freshman_](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=College%20Freshman) year, lots of work and stuff, but that doesn't stop me from doing stupid things 😅 instead of studying.

Through this blog, I would love to share all the research work I'll be workign on, Projects i've started and share some stuff that I find really interesting. I'll also be sharing some of my notes that have helped learn during my preparation. I'm a fan of open-source collaboration and other stuff and this probably the only place to store my rants 🥳

Currently running on my teams custom static site generator ❤️
