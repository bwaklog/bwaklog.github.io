## About Me

I'm a computer science freshman at PES University, Bangalore.
I love exploring and building projects. Take a look at what I've [built](/pages/projects/) (or my [Github](https://github.com/anirudhsudhir)).

## What I'm working on right now

- Building [Bingo](https://github.com/anirudhsudhir/Bingo), a pastebin written in Go with templating and persistence.
- Learning the Rust programming language.
